# Use Hash#map to iterate over numbers and return an array containing each number divided by 2.
# Assign the returned array to a variable named half_numbers and print its value using #p.

numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

# answer

half_numbers = numbers.map {|_, v| v / 2 }
p half_numbers # [50, 25, 5]
