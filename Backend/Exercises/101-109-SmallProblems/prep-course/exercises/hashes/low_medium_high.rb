# Use Hash#select to iterate over numbers and return a hash containing only key-value pairs where the value
# is less than 25. Assign the returned hash to a variable named low_numbers and print its value using #p.

numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

# answer

low_numbers = numbers.select do |key, value|
                value < 25
              end

 p low_numbers  # {low: 10}
