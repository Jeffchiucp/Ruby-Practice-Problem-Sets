# In the code below, an array containing the numbers 1 through 5 is assigned to numbers.
# Use Array#map to iterate over numbers and return a new array with each number doubled.
# Assign the returned array to a variable named doubled_numbers and print its value using #p.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# answer

doubled_numbers = numbers.map do |num|
                    num * 2
                  end

p doubled_numbers # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
